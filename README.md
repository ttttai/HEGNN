# HEGNN
We propose Heterogeneous E(n)-Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (HEGNNs). This model is designed for heterogeneous graphs with edge associated features and node coordinates. HEGNNs are capable of capturing complex and diverse relationships in graphs while preserving the equivariance properties with respect to geometric transformations. By incorporating node and edge heterogeneity into the model design, HEGNNs can learn by considering the spatial relationships between different types of nodes. Moreover, the equivariant properties allow it to generalize effectively to graphs with similar spatial relationships in different regions.
